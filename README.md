## Glossary

### Agent
An AI assistant that can perform tasks autonomously. In kortex-cli, agents are the different AI tools (Claude Code, Goose, Cursor) that can be launched and configured.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
The underlying AI model that powers the agents. Examples include Claude (by Anthropic), GPT (by OpenAI), and other language models.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external data sources and tools. MCP servers provide agents with additional capabilities like database access, API integrations, or file system operations.

### Skills
Pre-configured capabilities or specialized functions that can be enabled for an agent. Skills extend what an agent can do, such as code review, testing, or specific domain knowledge.
